# Stack
In this part of the repository will be implemented the Abstract Data Type --> Stack
## Formal definition
The ADT is a special type of linked list with the restriction of the insert and the elimination <br>
in one position, called head or stack's head. <br>

It's a LIFO (Last in, Last Out) Linked List, in this type will always exist an element (if it isn't empty) in the stack's head
that is the only one that is visible or can be accesed. <br>

## Implementation
The implementation of the stacks is based in two python classes:
- <a href="https://github.com/JuanjoLopez19/PythonATDs/blob/main/stack/Stack.py" > Stack </a>
- <a href="https://github.com/JuanjoLopez19/PythonATDs/blob/main/stack/node.py" > Node </a>
