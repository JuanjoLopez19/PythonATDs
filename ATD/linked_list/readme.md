# Linked List

In this part of the repository will be implemented the Abstract Data Type --> Linked List. <br>
In fact, python is an Object Progamming Language and it brings it's own List implementation in the arrays. <br>
But as part of a researching and practise project I will implement the Linked List with fictitious node.

## Formal definition

The ATD Linked List is an ordered secuence of zero or more elements of a determinated data type (integer, string, boolean, dicts... Any type that can be defined in python) --> a1, a2, a3 ... aN <br>
The elements' order is determinated of its sequence's position, being ai the element in the position i

## Implementation

The implementation of the linked list is based in two python classes:
- <a href="https://github.com/JuanjoLopez19/PythonATDs/tree/main/list/linked_list.py">List </a>
- <a href="https://github.com/JuanjoLopez19/PythonATDs/blob/main/list/node.py"> Node </a>
